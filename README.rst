Building the Windows Installer (.exe)
-------------------------------------

This repository has been configured to natively produce an ``.exe`` installer using CPack and NSIS.

To generate the ``.exe`` installer locally on a Windows machine, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
1. **Visual Studio 2022** (with C++ Desktop Development tools)
2. **CMake** (v3.24+)
3. **NSIS** (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) for installer generation.

### Build Instructions

Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell terminal in the root of the cloned repository and execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: bat

   mkdir build
   cd build
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
   cmake --build . --config Release --parallel
   cpack -G NSIS -C Release

After CPack finishes running, the ``obs-studio-30.0.0-modified-windows.exe`` file will be generated and available in your ``build`` directory.
